Assignment 4

In this project I made use of curves to draw irregularly shaped patterns like a winding race track. In particular, I made use of Hermite curves, calculating the position of a point at a particular time using the equation. I used Hermite curves for both the track and the path of the race cars. I utilized the glmatrix library for translating and rotating points and shapes based on transformation matrices to allow the car to follow and rotate along the path. This project will run with the gl-matrix-min.js file in it. I created this in VSCode on a Macbook pro.

My project is a race car track drawn using Hermite curves. I tried to make the car move as accurately as possible, slowing down for the sharp turns. Both the track and the path of the car were calculated using piecewise Hermite curves. I added a ton of details to try to make it look like a real race track. The slider at the bottom controls whether the path of the car is visible or not.

Hope you enjoy!
