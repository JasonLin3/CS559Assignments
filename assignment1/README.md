Assignment 1

My first assignment for CS559 is an underwater scene with a slider-controlled crab and 2 sharks. It makes use of more unconventional polygons and jagged shapes to create a scene of a crab hiding behind a rock from 2 sharks passing by. I make use of a bezier curve function that helps to draw curves. The setup function is called on loading, which calls the draw function, making use of smaller functions to help draw components of the entire scene.

This project makes use of just base libraries and should be able to be run in the browser simply by opening the html file. I produced the code using VSCode on macOS and ran it through the Google Chrome browser.
